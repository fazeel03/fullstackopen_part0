# Full Stack Open – Part 0 Diagrams

This repository contains the required sequence diagrams for **Part 0** of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course from the University of Helsinki.

The diagrams are created using [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) syntax and saved as separate markdown files for each exercise.

## Contents

- **0.4_new_note_diagram.md**: Depicts the sequence of network requests when a user adds a new note on the classic notes app.
- **0.5_spa_diagram.md**: Shows the process when a user loads the Single Page Application (SPA) version of the notes app.
- **0.6_new_note_spa_diagram.md**: Illustrates what happens when submitting a new note in the SPA version; handled entirely on the client side with an API call.

## Viewing the Diagrams

- On GitHub: Diagrams will automatically render in the markdown files.
- Locally: You can preview Mermaid diagrams using VS Code extensions like "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" or online at [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/).

**Note:** Each markdown file contains the exercise number, a short title, and the Mermaid diagram code block.
